# Mixed-GP
Code from my 4th year maths project. Contains functions to fit a GP to mixed interval, point + ordinal data. Also contains code to perform active learning given costs for requesting each data type.

Currently under construction. Version here has expectation propagation/active learning implemented for only point + interval data.
